		<mark>Path<sub>3000</sub> of Exile<sup>3000</sup></mark> is a free-to-play action role-playing video game developed and published by Grinding Gear Games. Following an open beta phase, the game was released for Microsoft Windows in October 2013. A version for Xbox One was released in August 2017, and a PlayStation 4 version was released in March 2019. Path of Exile takes place in the dark fantasy world, where the government of the island nation of Oriath exiles people to the continent of Wraeclast, a ruined continent home to many ancient gods. Taking control of an exile, players can choose to play as one of seven character classes â€“ Marauder, Duelist, Ranger, Shadow, Witch, Templar, and Scion. Players are then tasked with fighting their way back to Oriath, defeating ancient gods and great evils during their journey.

    <P> 
    	The player controls a single character from an overhead perspective and explores large outdoor areas and caves or dungeons, battling monsters and fulfilling quests from non-player characters (NPCs) to gain experience points and equipment. The game borrows heavily from the Diablo series, particularly Diablo II.[8] All areas aside from the central encampments are randomly generated for increased re-playability. While all players on a single server can freely mingle in encampments, gameplay outside of encampments is highly instanced, providing every player or party with an isolated map to freely explore.[9][10] Players can choose from seven available classes to play as (Duelist, Marauder, Ranger, Scion, Shadow, Templar and Witch).[11][12] Each of these classes are aligned with one or two of the three core attributes: Strength, Dexterity, or Intelligence. The exception is the Scion, formerly a locked prestige class released in 2013, which is aligned with all three attributes. The different classes are not restricted from investing into skills not aligned with their core attributes, but will have easier access to skills that are aligned with their core attributes.[13][14] Items are randomly generated from a wide variety of basic types and endowed with special properties and gem sockets. They come in different rarities with increasingly powerful properties. This makes a large part of gameplay dedicated to finding well-balanced and synergistic equipment. Skill gems can be placed in gem sockets of armor, weapons and some types of rings,[8][15] giving them an active skill. As the character advances and levels up, the equipped skill gems also gain experience, allowing the skills themselves to level up and increase in potency.
    </P>

    <p>
    	Active skills can be modified by items known as Support Gems.[16] Depending upon the number of linked sockets the player possesses, a primary attack or skill can be modified with increased attack speed, faster projectiles, multiple projectiles, chaining hits, life leech, auto-cast spells on critical strike, and more. Given limits on the number of sockets, players must prioritize gem usage.[17] All classes share the same selection of 1,325 passive skills,[18] from which the player can choose one each time their character levels up, and as an occasional quest reward. These passive skills improve the core attributes and grant further enhancements such as increased Mana, Health, damage, defenses, regeneration, speed, and more. Each one of the characters start on a different position on the passive skill tree. The passive skill tree is arranged in a complex network starting in separate trunks for each class (aligned with the permutations of the three core attributes). The player must therefore not only focus on maximizing all modifiers related to his primary offense and defense, but must also take care to select the most efficient path through the passive skill tree. As of the 3.0 Fall of Oriath Release, the maximum possible number of passive skill points was 123 (99 from leveling and 24 from quest rewards).[18] Each class also has access to an Ascendancy class, which grants much stronger, specialized bonuses. Each class has three Ascendancy classes to choose from, except for the Scion, who only has one Ascendancy class that combines the elements of all other Ascendancy classes. Up to 8 Ascendancy skill points can be assigned out of 12 or 14.

		The game is often cited as the world's largest esport, with an international competitive scene composed of 12 leagues. The domestic leagues culminate in the annual League of Legends World Championship. The 2019 championship had over 100 million unique viewers, peaking at a concurrent viewership of 44 million. Domestic and international events have been broadcast on livestreaming websites such as Twitch, YouTube, Bilibili, as well as cable television sports channel ESPN.

		League of Legends is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game in which the player controls a character ("champion") with a set of unique abilities from an isometric perspective.[3][4] As of April 2021, there are 155 champions available to play.[5] Over the course of a match, champions gain levels by accruing experience points (XP) through killing enemies.[6] Items also increase champions' strength,[7] and are bought with gold, which players accrue passively over time and earn actively by defeating the opposing team's minions,[3] champions, or defensive structures.[6][7] In the main game mode, Summoner's Rift, items are purchased through a shop menu available to players only when their champion is in the team's base.[3] Each match is discrete; levels and items do not transfer from one match to another.

<br>
		Summoner's Rift is the flagship game mode of League of Legends and the most prominent in professional-level play.[9][10][11] The mode has a ranked competitive ladder; a matchmaking system determines a player's skill level and generates a starting rank from which they can climb. There are nine tiers; the least skilled are Iron, Bronze, and Silver, and the highest are Master, Grandmaster, and Challenger.[12][a]
	</p>
	<p>
		Two teams of five players compete to destroy the opposing team's "Nexus", which is guarded by the enemy champions and defensive structures known as "turrets".[14] Each team's Nexus is located in their base, where players start the game or reappear after death.[14] Non-player characters known as minions are generated from each team's Nexus and advance towards the enemy base along three lanes guarded by turrets: top, middle, and bottom.[15] Each team's base contains three "inhibitors", one behind the third tower from the center of each lane. Destroying one of the enemy team's inhibitors causes stronger allied minions to spawn in that lane, and allows the attacking team to damage the enemy Nexus and the two turrets guarding it.[16] The regions in between the lanes are collectively known as the "jungle", which is inhabited by "monsters" that, like minions, respawn at regular intervals. Like minions, monsters provide gold and XP when killed.[17] Another, more powerful class of monster resides within the river that separates each team's jungle.[18] These monsters require multiple players to defeat and grant special abilities to their slayers' team. For example, teams can gain a powerful allied unit after killing the Rift Herald, permanent strength boosts by killing dragons, and stronger, more durable minions by killing Baron Nashor.[19]	
	</p>
	<p>	
		Summoner's Rift matches can last from as little as 15 minutes to over an hour.[20] Although the game does not enforce where players may go, conventions have arisen over the game's lifetime: typically one player goes in the top lane, one in the middle lane, one in the jungle, and two in the bottom lane.[3][6][21] Players in a lane kill minions to accumulate gold and XP (termed "farming") and try to prevent their opponent from doing the same. A fifth champion, known as a "jungler", farms the jungle monsters and, when powerful enough, assists their teammates in a lane
	</p>
	<p>
		Besides Summoner's Rift, League of Legends has two other permanent game modes. ARAM ("All Random, All Mid") is a five-versus-five mode like Summoner's Rift, but with only one long lane, no jungle area, and with champions randomly chosen for players.[23][24] Given the small size of the map, players must be vigilant in avoiding enemy abilities.[25]
	</p>
	<p>
		Teamfight Tactics is an auto battler released in June 2019 and made a permanent game mode the following month.[26][27] As with others in its genre, players build a team and battle to be the last one standing. Players do not directly affect combat but position their units on a board for them to fight automatically against opponents each round.[28] Teamfight Tactics is available for iOS and Android and has cross-platform play with the Windows and macOS clients.[29]
	</p>
	<p>
		Other game modes have been made available temporarily, typically aligning with in-game events.[30][31] Ultra Rapid Fire (URF) mode was available for two weeks as a 2014 April Fools Day prank. In the mode, champion abilities have no resource cost, significantly reduced cooldown timers, increased movement speed, reduced healing, and faster attacks.[32][33] A year later, in April 2015, Riot disclosed that they had not brought the mode back because its unbalanced design resulted in player "burnout". The developer also said the costs associated with maintaining and balancing URF were too high.[34] Other temporary modes include One for All and Nexus Blitz. One for All has players pick a champion for all members of their team to play.[35][36] In Nexus Blitz, players participate in a series of mini-games on a compressed map

		Riot Games' founders Brandon Beck and Marc Merill had an idea for a spiritual successor to Defense of the Ancients, known as DotA. A mod for Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos, DotA required players to buy Warcraft III and install custom software; The Washington Post's Brian Crecente said the mod "lacked a level of polish and was often hard to find and set up".[38] Phillip Kollar of Polygon noted that Blizzard Entertainment supported Warcraft III with an expansion pack, then shifted their focus to other projects while the game still had players. Beck and Merill sought to create a game that would be supported over a significantly longer period.[39]
	</p>
	<p>
		Beck and Merill held a DotA tournament for students at the University of Southern California, with an ulterior goal of recruitment. There they met Jeff Jew, later a producer on League of Legends. Jew was very familiar with DotA and spent much of the tournament teaching others how to play. Beck and Merill invited him to an interview, and he joined Riot Games as an intern.[38] Beck and Merill recruited two figures involved with DotA: Steve Feak, one of its designers,[38] and Steve Mescon, who ran a support website to assist players.[40][41] Feak said early development was highly iterative, comparing it to designing DotA.[42]
	</p>
	<p>
		A demonstration of League of Legends built in the Warcraft III game engine was completed in four months and then shown at the 2007 Game Developers Conference.[39] There, Beck and Merill had little success with potential investors. Publishers were confused by the game's free-to-play business model and lack of a single-player mode. The free-to-play model was untested outside of Asian markets,[38] so publishers were primarily interested in a retail release, and the game's capacity for a sequel.[39] In 2008, Riot reached an agreement with holding company Tencent to oversee the game's launch in China.[39]
	</p>
	<p>
		League of Legends was announced October 7, 2008, for Microsoft Windows.[43][44] Closed beta-testing began in April 2009.[43][45] Upon the launch of the beta, seventeen champions were available.[46] Riot initially aimed to ship the game with 20 champions but doubled the number before the game's full release in North America on October 27, 2009.[47][48] The game's full name was announced as League of Legends: Clash of Fates. Riot planned to use the subtitle to signal when future content was available, but decided they were silly and dropped it before launch.

		</strong>
	<br>
		League of Legends receives regular updates in the form of patches. Although previous games had utilized patches to ensure no one strategy dominated, League of Legends' patches made keeping pace with the developer's changes a core part of the game. In 2014, Riot standardized their patch cadence to once approximately every two or three weeks.
	<p>
	</p>
		The development team includes hundreds of game designers and artists. In 2016, the music team had four full-time composers and a team of producers creating audio for the game and its promotional materials.[50] As of 2021, the game has over 150 champions,[5] and Riot Games periodically overhauls the visuals and gameplay of the oldest in the roster.[51] Although only available for Microsoft Windows at launch, a Mac version of the game was made available in March 2013.
